# Project Name

The assignment was to use javascript to make alert() popups and prompt() popups. 

My project is a Javascript pizzeria where the user gets to choose a type a food, subtype to that food and confirm their order. 

## The problem

I made my code step by step. My first problem was that "if else" didn't catch the users answer. After testing out different solutions, that I googled, i figured out that it was because i didn't treat the users answer as i String. After that it worked. 

Another problem was to get the different food types the be connected with the subtypes. I used if-else for this one but can now see that the code became too long and complicated. To do it this way is not effective if there are more choises and subchoises than the ones I have. After attending the code sessions and using google I would have chosen to use Switch method instead as you can store alot mot variables in fewer lines of code that way.
